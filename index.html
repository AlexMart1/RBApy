		<b>RBApy</b> is a Python package that enables creation and simulation of bacterial Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) models (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2015.10.003">Goelzer et al. Metab. Eng. 2015</a>), and can be interfaced to <a href="https://escher.github.io/">Escher maps</a> and <a href="https://www.proteomaps.net/">Proteomaps</a> for visualisation. The inputs needed in order to create an RBA model are an annotated metabolic reconstruction in <a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)</a> format and an <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/help/organism-name">Uniprot organism ID</a>, which is used for automatic download and integration of macromolecular composition data into the model. The RBA model accurately captures the macromolecular composition of the cell, and can be refined indefinitely by adding cellular process definitions (such as translation, transcription, secretion, chaperoning etc.)

	<p>
		RBA models for two bacterial species (<i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>) have already been developed. You can access these models here: <a href="https://github.com/SysBioInra/Bacterial-RBA-models">link</a>.
