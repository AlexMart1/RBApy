	<p>
		<b>RBApy</b> is a Python package that enables creation and simulation of Resource Balance Analysis (RBA) models, and can be interfaced to <a href="https://escher.github.io/">Escher maps</a> and <a href="https://www.proteomaps.net/">Proteomaps</a> for visualisation. The inputs needed in order to create an RBA model are an annotated metabolic reconstruction in <a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)</a> format and an <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/help/organism-name">Uniprot organism ID</a>, which is used for automatic download and integration of macromolecular composition data into the model. The RBA model accurately captures the macromolecular composition of the cell, and can be refined indefinitely by adding cellular process definitions (such as translation, transcription, secretion, chaperoning etc.)
